   * The data for the component.
   *
   * This is only present on the base component (e.g., 'Module'), so that the
   * data initially given by the user may be globally modified or added to by
   * components.
   *
   * An associative array of data for the module, [passed by reference so data
   * on generated files can be added!?!?!?!]
   * The keys can *mostly* be taken straight from form values. They are as
   * follows:
   *   - 'base': The type of component: 'module'.
   *   - 'module_root_name': The machine name for the module.
   *   - 'module_readable_name': The human readable name for the module.
   *   - 'module_short_description': The module's description text.
   *   - 'module_help_text': Help text for the module. If this is given, then
   *      hook_help() is automatically added to the list of required hooks.
   *   - 'hooks': An associative array whose keys are full hook names
   *     (eg 'hook_menu'), where requested hooks have a value of TRUE.
   *     Unwanted hooks may also be included as keys provided their value is
   *     FALSE.
   *   - 'module_dependencies': A string of module dependencies, separated by
   *      spaces, e.g. 'forum views'.
   *   - 'module_package': The module package.
   *   - 'component_folder': (optional) The destination folder to write the
   *     module files to.
   *   - 'module_files': ??? OBSOLETE!? added by this function. A flat array
   *     of filenames that have been generated.
   *   - 'requested_build': An array whose keys are names of subcomponents to
   *      build. Component names are defined in subComponents(), and include:
   *      - 'all': everything we can do.
   *      - 'code': PHP code files.
   *      - 'info': the info file.
   *      - 'module': the .module file.
   *      - 'install': the .install file.
   *      - 'tests': test file.
   *      - 'api': api.php hook documentation file.
   *      - FILE ID: requests a particular code file, by the abbreviated name.
   *        This is the filename without the initial 'MODULE.' or the '.inc'
   *        extension.
   *   - 'requested_components':
   * Properties added by generators:
   *  - 'hook_file_data': Added by the Hooks generator. Keyed by the component
   *    names of the ModuleCodeFile type components that Hooks adds.
